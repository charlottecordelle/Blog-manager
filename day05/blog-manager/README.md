# Project Description

This project is a **personal mini-blog** designed for **students and young professionals** who want to share their learnings, experiences, and projects related to school and early career development.

The goal of this project is to practice front-end development concepts while building a simple, clean, and functional blog interface. Users can create and view articles, with data stored locally in the browser (localStorage).

This project was developed as part of a **school assignment**.
